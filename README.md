This PHP project demonstrates three important programming concepts — recursion, binary search trees (BST), and hash tables — applied to managing and displaying book data.

recusive.php shows how to use a recursive function to traverse and display a hierarchical library structure with categories and books.

bst.php implements a Binary Search Tree that organizes books by title, allowing efficient insertion and in-order display of book details.

hashtable.php uses a Hash Table to store and quickly retrieve detailed information about each book based on a unique key.

Together, these files demonstrate different ways to store, organize, and access data efficiently in PHP
